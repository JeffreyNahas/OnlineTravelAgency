# TravelAgency
This Java project simulates an online travel agency, focusing on object-oriented programming concepts to manage travel reservations. It includes classes such as Airport, Room, Hotel, Reservation (and its subclasses FlightReservation, HotelReservation, BnBReservation), Basket, and Customer.

Usage:
Setup: Clone the repository to get the Java source files. Ensure all classes are within the assignment1 package.
Compilation: Compile the Java files using a Java-supported IDE or the command line.
Execution: Run the main class to initiate the program. Use the classes to simulate creating and managing various travel reservations.
This project is designed for learning and applying key object-oriented principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, along with handling complex relationships between objects without relying on Java's built-in collection frameworks.

Explore the simulation to understand the intricacies of managing a travel agency's operations programmatically.
